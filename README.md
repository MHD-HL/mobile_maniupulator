# Mobile Manipulator

This repository contains the code and resources for my graduation project: a Mobile Manipulator using Robot Operating System (ROS).
Project Overview

The project goal is to develop a robot capable of fetching objects by name. When a user calls out the name of an object, the robot uses computer vision with ArUco markers to locate the object, navigates to it autonomously, picks it up using a robotic arm, and then turns around to place the object at a desired location.
Technologies Used

 - Robot Operating System (ROS) Noetic

 - Artificial Intelligence techniques: Computer Vision, Voice Recognition

 - Hardware: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, servo motors (for robotic arm), stepper motors (for mobile base), and their drivers

Features

 - Voice-controlled object fetching by name

 - Object detection and localization using ArUco marker recognition

 - Mobile navigation to the object's position

 - Object grasping and manipulation with a robotic arm
